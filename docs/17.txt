New York University (NYU) is a private nonprofit research university based in New York City. In 1830, then Secretary of Treasury under Thomas Jefferson, Albert Gallatin declared his intention to establish "in this immense and fast-growing city... a system of rational and practical education fitting and graciously opened to all." A "literary and scientific convention" held in City Hall attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university where people would be admitted based upon merit rather than birthright or social class.  Founded in 1831, NYU's primary campus is centrally located in Manhattan, within Greenwich Village, as well as having campuses based throughout New York City.NYU has grown into an international university, where students can travel for education at NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai, as well as to centers in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Washington, D.C. In 2018, NYU was ranked amongst the top 30 universities in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities, Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and U.S. News & World Report.Alumni include heads of state, royalty, eminent scientists, inventors and entrepreneurs, media figures, founders and CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and astronauts.
