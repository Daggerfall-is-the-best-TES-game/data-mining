The George Washington University (GW, GWU, or George Washington) is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Charted by an act of the United States Congress in 1821, GW was founded on the basis of the wishes of George Washington, 1st President of the United States, for a national university within the nation's capital. The original name of the institution was the Columbian College in the District of Columbia.
The university is organized into 14 colleges and schools, including the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the School of Media and Public Affairs, the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration, the GW Law School, and the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design.

GWU has two satellite campuses: the Mount Vernon Campus, located in D.C.'s Foxhall neighborhood and the Virginia Science and Technology Campus in the Washington Metropolitan Area. It is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia.
George Washington, the 1st President of the United States, advocated the establishment of a national university in the U.S. capital in his first State of the Union address in 1790 and continued to promote this idea throughout his career and until his death. In his will, Washington left shares in the Potomac Company to endow the university. However, due to the company's financial difficulties, funds were raised independently. On 9 February 1821, the university was founded by an Act of Congress, making it one of only 5 universities in the United States with a Congressional charter.George Washington alumni include numerous prominent politicians (including the current President of Togo, the current Prime-Minister of Pakistan, and the current Premier of Bermuda), U.S. Military officials (including four living former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), business people (including Lee Kun-hee, Chairman of Samsung Group, & Dan Glickman, CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America), and many other historical figures (including Syngman Rhee, 1st President of South Korea, Edward Teller, "father of the hydrogen bomb", Ralph A.
